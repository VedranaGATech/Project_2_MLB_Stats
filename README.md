   This project will deliver a database about Major League Baseball dated from 2000-2015. We performed the ETL process and create documentation which includes includes: 

    ● Datasets used and their sources 

    ● Types of data wrangling performed (data cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating) 

    ● The schemata used in the final production database

We will use Python and Pandas for transformation, which can also be done with SQL or a specialized ETL tool. 
Teams is responsible for:
  - Citing the data sources
  - Extracting the data from those sources
  - Transforming the data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
  - Loading the data into a database (relational or non-relational)

We will also prepare a report to address the following points:
  
 # **EXTRACT:** 
 
 First the following 7 data sources are loaded. (Your original data sources and how the data were formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin4, etc.))

      1. Teams and Cities
       - Worldatlas.com was our source for a list of the current Major League Baseball teams and their cities.  
       - The data resided in the html of a page on the website.
       - We utilized BeautifulSoup in Jupyter Notebook to isolate and extract the team and city information from the html.           
      3. Pitching.csv 
      4. Batting.csv
      5. Payrolls.csv
      6. Salaries.csv
      7. 0519_baseball_reference.csv
  
  
 #  **TRANSFORM:**
  
  What data cleaning or transformation was required
  During the transformation process, we utilized jupyter notebook. 
  
  ## 1. Teams and Cities
     - Looped through the resulting rows of the html extract and built ORM Team and City objects
     - Committed ORM objects to Postgresql tables.  
     - Subsequently, a query from each of the tables was saved as Teams.csv and Cities.csv to facilitate easier testing
     - Built a data dictionary of team names and abbreviations so other data sets could lookup the team ids

 ## 3. Pitching.csv 
     - Original Pitching.csv was loaded and stored in SQL Database
     - Then brought over to Jupyter Notebook for filtering (year) and cleaning (removed unusable columns)
     - Created relation to Teams file for team_id identification 
     - Stored clean csv file in database so only needed data can be queried

 ## 4. Batting.csv
     - First took the Batting.csv and stored it as a SQL Database
     - Then brought it over to Jupyter Notebook
     - Queried only the data we needed
     
     ![2022-09-07 19_29_13-BattingStats - Jupyter Notebook and 4 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100164773/189000578-90cf0d09-04b6-4cce-a6df-bc0ba98376c8.png)

     - Then Group each stat by year, team and playerID to get total sums of each stat
![2022-09-07 19_31_21-BattingStats - Jupyter Notebook and 4 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100164773/189000970-6267079a-8a98-4e22-93a5-ff7e245f7a20.png)

     - And saved it as a new CSV called Batting_Stats.csv

 ## 5. Payrolls.csv


  Insert how it was transformed "\n"


  ## 6. Salaries.csv


  nsert how it was transformed

  
 #  **LOAD:** 
 
  The final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

  
  The final database we used was postgreSQL
