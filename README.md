Perform the ETL process and create your documentation. Documentation must include: 

    ● Datasets used and their sources 

    ● Types of data wrangling performed (data cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating) 

    ● The schemata used in the final production database 

 
We will use Python and Pandas for transformation, which can also be done with SQL or a specialized ETL tool. 
Teams is responsible for:
  - Citing the data sources
  - Extracting the data from those sources
  - Transforming the data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
  - Loading the data into a database (relational or non-relational)

We will also prepare a report to address the following points:
  
  EXTRACT: 
  Your original data sources and how the data were formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin4, etc.)
  
  TRANSFER: 
  What data cleaning or transformation was required
  
  LOAD: 
  The final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
