   This project will deliver a database about Major League Baseball. We included 

Perform the ETL process and create your documentation. Documentation must include: 

    ● Datasets used and their sources 

    ● Types of data wrangling performed (data cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating) 

    ● The schemata used in the final production database 

 
We will use Python and Pandas for transformation, which can also be done with SQL or a specialized ETL tool. 
Teams is responsible for:
  - Citing the data sources
  - Extracting the data from those sources
  - Transforming the data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
  - Loading the data into a database (relational or non-relational)

We will also prepare a report to address the following points:
  
  EXTRACT: First the following 6/7 data sources are loaded. (Your original data sources and how the data were formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin4, etc.))
  1. Teams.csv
  2. Cities.csv
  3. Pitching.csv (OR IS THIS ONE PITCHING FINAL?)
  4. Batting.csv
  5. Payrolls.csv
  6. Salaries.csv
  
  
  TRANSFORM:
  What data cleaning or transformation was required
  During the transformation process, we utilized jupyter notebook. 
  1.Teams.csv
  insert how it was transformed
  2. Cities.csv
  insert how it was transformed
  4. Pitching.csv (OR IS THIS ONE PITCHING FINAL?)
  insert how it was transformed
  6. Batting.csv
  Insert how it was transformed
  8. Payrolls.csv
  Insert how it was transformed
  10. Salaries.csv
  nsert how it was transformed

  
  LOAD: 
  The final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
  The final database we used was postgreSQL
