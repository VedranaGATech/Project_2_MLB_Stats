# Project_2_MLB_Stats


Perform the ETL process and create your documentation. Documentation must include: 

  ● Datasets used and their sources 

  ● Types of data wrangling performed (data cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating) 

  ● The schemata used in the final production database 

 

We will use Python and Pandas for transformation, which can also be done with SQL or a specialized ETL tool.
